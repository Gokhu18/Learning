        "\n",
        "Reduce the time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Problem Statement Scenario:\n",
        "Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations. These include the passenger safety cell with a crumple zone, the airbag, and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader among premium carmakers. Mercedes-Benz is the leader in the premium car industry. With a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams.\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure the safety and reliability of every unique car configuration before they hit the road, the company’s engineers have developed a robust testing system. As one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Mercedes-Benz’s production lines. However, optimizing the speed of their testing system for many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "You are required to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Others will work with a dataset representing different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Mercedes-Benz’s standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Following actions should be performed:\n",
        "\n",
        "- If for any column(s), the variance is equal to zero, then you need to remove \n",
        "  those variable(s).\n",
        "- Check for null and unique values for test and train sets.\n",
        "- Apply label encoder.\n",
        "- Perform dimensionality reduction.\n",
        "- Predict your test_df values using XGBoost.\n",
        "- Find the datasets [here.](https://github.com/Simplilearn-Edu/Machine-Learning--Projects)"
